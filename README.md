# Orengo/Baker FunFam collaboration

This repo is currently here to store data for a working collaboration between the [https://www.bakerlab.org/](Baker group)
and the [http://orengogroup.info/](Orengo group) regarding modelling protein structures for Functional Family (FunFam)
alignments in CATH.

## Datasets

### 01.test

Contains an initial set of 5 FunFam protein sequence alignments (STOCKHOLM format) to use for general testing.

Criteria for selection:

* EC annotation
* high number of sequences
* high sequence diversity
* low percentage of gaps
