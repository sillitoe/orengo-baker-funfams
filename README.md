# Orengo/Baker FunFam collaboration

This repo is currently here to store data for a working collaboration between the [Baker group](https://www.bakerlab.org/)
and the [Orengo group](http://orengogroup.info/) regarding modelling protein structures for Functional Family (FunFam)
alignments in CATH.

## Datasets

### 01.test

Initial set of 5 FunFam protein sequence alignments (STOCKHOLM format) to use for general testing: 

[`dataset/01.test/01.test.sto.tgz`](https://github.com/sillitoe/orengo-baker-funfams/blob/master/dataset/01.test/01.test.sto.tgz)

Selection criteria:

* 1 EC annotation
* reasonable number of sequences
* reasonable sequence diversity
* not too high gap percentage
